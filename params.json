{"name":"Clone","tagline":"A File Tree Cloning Tool","body":"**clone** is a file tree cloning tool which runs 3 threads - a scheduler (main), a reader,\r\nand a writer thread. Reading and writing occurs in parallel. While this is most beneficial\r\nfor copying data from one physical disk to another, clone is also very well suited\r\nfor cloning a file tree to any place on the same disk.\r\n\r\nCloning includes the whole directory hierarchy, i.e. sub-directories, files, hard links,\r\nsymbolic links, attributes (modes, flags, times), extended attributes and access control lists.\r\n\r\n**clone** is useful for cloning (thus backing-up) live file systems, and it can also be used in\r\nincremental and synchonization mode.\r\n\r\n**clone** works on FreeBSD and Mac OS X.\r\n\r\n**clone** is very fast, for example, cloning a whole UFS2 file hierarchy on FreeBSD 9.1 of in total\r\n2.3 TBytes of data from one hard disk to another took 7.5 h, so the average transfer rate\r\nfor all kind of files (very small up to very big ones) was about 89 MByte/s.\r\n\r\nSnapshots can be downloaded from the **clone Google Drive**\r\n\r\n      https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BzyUSAiURzitVGlOeXFsTW9XOVk\r\n\r\nThe latest snapshot is **clone-1.0.6.tar.gz**\r\n(SHA256 = 0ed5d2ca266b42924f7ef9495fccae235a0d5665c1b5a16cf6d86214f3d35ed2):\r\n\r\n      https://googledrive.com/host/0BzyUSAiURzitVGlOeXFsTW9XOVk/clone-1.0.6.tar.gz\r\n\r\n***\r\nOn my [BLog](http://blog.obsigna.net/), I posted an article in German language on how to employ **clone** for the [Backup Strategy of a FreeBSD Home Server](http://blog.obsigna.net/?p=475).

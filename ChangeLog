•••• 2013-06-27 -- Created a snapshot of r41 for release as v1.0.2, provided it for download at GC, and submitted it to FreeBSD ports ••••


2013-06-27 10:03  rj - r41

2013-02-20 23:29  rj - r37

   * ChangeLog:
     - release of version 1.0.1 (r37)

2013-02-20 21:55  rj - r36

   * clone.c:
     - when reading, do not assume anything about the file size
     - when the field d_type of struct dirent is DT_UNDEFINED, then call lstat() to obtain the type
     - rename fileCopy() to fileCopyScheduler()
     - dispense virgin qitems, set stage to nascent in the fileCopyScheduler()

2013-02-20 11:00  rj - r35

   * clone.c:
     - if the file size changed in-between scheduling and copying, then most probably
       other file attributes changed too, so lstat() the source again.
     - set version to 1.0.1

2013-02-20 01:08  rj - r34

   * clone.c:
     - on reading and writing, check only for real errors,
       e.g., an actual file size difference counts not as error.

2013-02-19 12:35  rj - r33

   * ChangeLog:
     - entry r32: corrected timestamp 06:18 to 12:18
     - entry r28: rights and obligations has been transferred from Cyclaero Ltda. to Dr. Rolf Jansen.

     - set version to 1.0.1b

2013-02-18 18:54  rj - r31

2013-02-18 18:28  rj - r30

   * clone.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj, utils.c:
     - minor polishing

2013-02-17 23:08  rj - r29

   * clone.c, utils.c, utils.h:
     - move setAttributes() out of the conditional compiling section, i.e. making it common.
     - instead, rename setTimes() to setTimesFlags() and move it into the conditional compiling section.
     - On Mac OS X, the flags need to be set before the times, and on FreeBSD the flags
       need to be set after the times -- in this respect, nothing has changed for FreeBSD.
     - some minor code formatting.

2013-02-17 12:40  rj - r28

   * Makefile, clone.1, clone.c, utils.c, utils.h:
     - Herewith, transferred all rights and obligations on the clone project, including
       copyright, from the Legal Entity Cyclaero Ltda. to the Natural Person Dr. Rolf Jansen.

2013-02-15 00:45  rj - r27

   * clone.c, utils.c:
     - on Mac OS X, setTimes() must be the last call in setAttributes.
     - on FreeBSD, lchflags() must be the last call (so it was before).

2013-02-15 00:30  rj - r26

   * clone.c, utils.c:
     - on Mac OS X, the d_type field of struct dirent does not reliably indicate
       the type for external file systems (e.g. NFS shares, UDF volumes, ??),
       therefore, need to switch most of the calls to stat() to lstat(),
       and extract the file type from the st_mode field of struct stat.
     - setTimes() shall be the final call in setAttributes, or in some cases
       the modifications time become not set.

2013-02-11 15:05  rj - r25

   * clone.1, clone.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj:
     - changed line-ending of man file from CRLF to LF
     - in the Xcode project enabled syntax coloring for the man file
     - removed the directory "related stuff" from the Xcode project

     - fixed a crashing bug in synchronization mode

     - minor lingual clarification in the descriptive text (transferring -> copying)

2013-02-08 12:06  rj - r19

   * Makefile:
     - soft-define the desired compiler

.Nm
is a file tree cloning tool which runs 3 threads - a scheduler (main), a reader, and a writer thread. Reading and writing occurs in parallel. While this is most beneficial for copying data from one physical disk to another,
.Nm
is also very well suited for cloning a file tree to any place on the same disk.
.Pp
Cloning includes the whole directory hierarchy, i.e. sub-directories, files, hard links, symbolic links, attributes (modes, flags, times), extended attributes and access control lists.
.Pp
.Nm
is useful for cloning (thus backing-up) live file systems, and it can also be used in incremental and synchronization mode.
.Pp
.Nm
works on FreeBSD and Mac OS X.
.Pp
.Nm
is very fast, for example, cloning a whole UFS2 file hierarchy on FreeBSD 9.1 of in total 2.3 TBytes of data from one hard disk to another took 7.5 h, so the average transfer rate for all kind of files (very small up to very big ones) was about 89 MByte/s.
.Pp
\fBOptional flags:\fP
.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It Fl c Ar roff | woff | rwoff
Selectively turn off the file system cache for reading or writing or for reading and writing -- the caches are on by default.
.It The options -d, -i, -s are mutually exclusive:
.It Fl d
Delete the contents of the destination before cloning, but do not remove the destination directory or mount point itself. Stop on error. Deletion requires user confirmation, unless it is confirmed inherently by the \fB-y\fP flag. Be careful, deletion cannot be undone! NOTE: It may take its time to empty hugh file trees, and it may be faster to use \fBnewfs(8)\fP for initializing big volumes.
.It Fl i
Incrementally add new content to or change content in the destination, but do not touch content in destination that does not exist in source.
.It Fl s
Completely synchronize destination with source.
.It Fl x Ar exclude-list
Colon separated list of entity names or full path names to be excluded from cloning. Use full path names to single out exactly one item. Use entity names, if all existing entities having that name should be excluded.
.It For example:
-x ".snap:/.sujournal:.DS_Store:/fullpath/to a/volatile cache"
.It Fl X Ar excl-list-file
File containing a list of entity names or full path names to be excluded -- one item per line.
.It Fl y
Automatically answer with y(es) to y|n confirmation prompts.
.It Fl h | Fl \&? | Sy \&?
Show the usage instructions.
.El
.Pp
\fBRequired arguments:\fP
.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It Ar source/
Path to the source directory or mount point to be cloned. The final '/' may be omitted.
.It Ar destination/
Path to the destination directory or mount point. If the destination does not exist, then it will be created. The final '/' may be omitted. 
.El
.Pp
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It Initial cloning of the root volume \fI/\fP to a volume mounted on \fI/mnt\fP:
clone / /mnt
.It Same as above, but empty \fI/mnt\fP before cloning:
clone -d / /mnt
.It Incrementally update the clone with respect to the master:
clone -i / /mnt
.It Keep the clone exactly synchronized to the master:
clone -s / /mnt
.It Create a non-versioned clone of a versioned source tree:
clone -x .svn /path/to/my/project /path/to/non-versioned/project
.It Clone a directory to a share and strip file system specific meta data:
clone -x ".DS_Store:.AppleDouble:.AppleDesktop:.appdisk" /path/to/afpvol /path/to/the/share

.Nm
has been carefully developed and tested. Anyway,
.Nm
is provided without any expressed or implied warrantee on being 100 % bug free.
.Pp
Unproper use of
.Nm
may delete or overwrite data. Take special care with the -d and the -s option. Also always be sure, that the last command line argument designates a path to a file tree which really is under disposition.
